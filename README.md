# 🏨 Hotel Management System (C++)

## 📌 Overview
This is a **console-based Hotel Management System** built in **C++** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles.  
It automates **room booking, food ordering, and billing**, and stores data in **CSV files** for persistence across sessions.

## ✨ Features
- **Room Booking** – View available rooms, reserve rooms, and update booking status.  
- **Food Ordering** – Order from a menu of items with prices stored in `menu.csv`.  
- **Billing** – Automatic calculation of total stay cost + food orders.  
- **Data Persistence** – Uses CSV files (`rooms.csv`, `menu.csv`, `bookings.csv`) to store and retrieve data.  
- **Multi-Record Support** – Handles **500+ bookings** efficiently.

## 📂 File Structure
```
HotelManagementSystem/
│── main.cpp            # Main program source code
│── rooms.csv           # Room details and availability
│── menu.csv            # Menu items and prices
│── bookings.csv        # Booking records and bills
│── README.md           # Project documentation
```

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **Language**: C++
- **Concepts**: OOP (classes, encapsulation, modular functions)
- **Data Storage**: CSV files
- **Compilation**: C++11 or above

## 🚀 How to Run
1. **Clone the project** or download all files into a single folder.  
2. Ensure `rooms.csv`, `menu.csv`, and `bookings.csv` are in the same directory as the executable.  
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ main.cpp -o hotel -std=c++11
   ```
4. Run the program:
   ```bash
   ./hotel
   ```
